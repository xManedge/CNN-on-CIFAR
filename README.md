## Dataset

### Description

The CIFAR-10 dataset is a benchmark dataset for image classification. It contains:

- **60,000 images**: 50,000 for training, 10,000 for testing.
- **Image size**: 32x32 pixels in RGB.
- **Classes**: 10 categories, each representing common objects.

### Classes

1. Airplane  
2. Automobile  
3. Bird  
4. Cat  
5. Deer  
6. Dog  
7. Frog  
8. Horse  
9. Ship  
10. Truck  

### Preprocessing

- Normalize pixel values to the range `[0, 1]`.
- Augment data with transformations like rotations and flips to improve generalization.

## Model Architecture

### Layer Breakdown

The CNN architecture includes the following layers:

1. **Convolutional Layers**: Extract spatial features from input images.
2. **ReLU Activation**: Introduces non-linearity.
3. **Pooling Layers**: Downsamples feature maps to reduce dimensionality.
4. **Dropout Layers**: Prevents overfitting by randomly deactivating neurons.
5. **Fully Connected Layers**: Maps features to class probabilities.
6. **Output Layer**: Uses Softmax activation for multi-class classification.

### Hyperparameters

- **Batch Size**: Controls the number of samples per training step.
- **Learning Rate**: Optimized for faster convergence.
- **Epochs**: Defines the number of complete passes through the training data.
- **Regularization**: Dropout and weight decay to combat overfitting.

## Training Pipeline

1. **Data Loading**: Load and preprocess CIFAR-10 images.
2. **Model Training**:
   - **Loss Function**: Categorical Crossentropy for multi-class classification.
   - **Optimizer**: Adaptive methods like Adam or SGD with momentum.
3. **Evaluation**: Assess accuracy and loss on the training and test datasets.
4. **Save and Load**: Save the trained model for reuse.

## Results

- **Training Accuracy**: Achieves strong performance on the training set.
- **Test Accuracy**: Balances generalization to unseen data.
- **Visualizations**: Includes accuracy and loss curves for model insights.
